   * Each step will be like a selection
   * First step is to select a Doctor. (Box, Card, Typography)
   * Second Step is to select the Time. (just print available times intervals of 45min). (Material UI - DatePicker , Chips)
   * Third Step is to take the patiences Data.  You will need to create the inputs (Material UI - Textfield)
   * 
   * NOTE: Make sure each component has a forward and backward. You can use Material Icons for this (this is inside Material UI)
   * NOTE2: Feel free to explore or use anything you think is good. Everything is almost created in Material UI
   * NOTE3: Use Dummy Data, dont think about Backend, practice Material UI ONLY
   * NOTE4: Avoid using raw HTML.   only BOX (div) or TYPOGRAPHY (p) . All Elements have a special inline styling.  sx={{mt: 1, marginTop: 1 // both the same}}
